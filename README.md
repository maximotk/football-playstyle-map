This repository is the implementation of **Football Playstyle Map**, a work-in-progress project that applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to football (soccer) data.

Currently, the dashboard focuses on:
- **Tab 1**: Football playstyle maps for major tournaments (World Cups, Euros, Copa Am√©rica, AFCON), categorizing teams and matches by playstyle.  
- Use of **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to extract latent factors (dimensions) of playstyle.  
- Interactive visualization of team clusters and dominant tactical patterns.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is still under development. Upcoming extensions (future dashboard tabs) will include:
- **Game-phase clustering** (separating offensive/defensive phases).  
- **Generative models** for simulating alternative tactical scenarios.

## üì¶ Requirements

To install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, build a reproducible Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t football-playstyle-map .
docker run -p 8501:8501 football-playstyle-map
```

## üìà Results

Applying **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** across all tournaments revealed approximately **4 major latent playstyle dimensions**.  

These dimensions capture recurring tactical patterns across teams and competitions.  
The exact decomposition, team clustering, and match-level visualizations can be explored directly in the **Streamlit dashboard**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These results are preliminary and part of an ongoing project. Future versions may refine the dimensionality or extend the analysis to game phases.

## üèãÔ∏è Training / Preprocessing

This repository does not train deep models; instead, it performs:
- **Preprocessing** (missing values, constants, scaling)  
- **Feature factorization** with NMF  
- **Rule-based clustering** of playstyles  
- **Dimensionality reduction** (t-SNE/UMAP) for visualization

The preprocessing and NMF factorization are applied across **all tournaments combined** in order to learn global playstyle dimensions.  
However, the visualizations and clustering results are displayed only for the **competition selected in the dashboard sidebar**.  

---

## üìä Evaluation

To run the full **unit tests** and check reproducibility:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=code/src --cov-report=term-missing
```

This will execute both component-level and integration tests.

## üéÆ Running the Dashboard

### How to Run

To launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard locally:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

By default the app loads **engineered StatsBomb match features** from `data/processed/`.  
The preprocessing and factorization (e.g. handling missing values, scaling, NMF) are automatically applied when the dashboard first runs.

Within the dashboard sidebar, you can:  
- **Select the competition** (e.g. FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro, Copa Am√©rica, AFCON).  
- Choose whether to include only **team-level features** (`_self` / unilateral mode),  
  or extend with **opponent-inclusive features** (`_opp` mode).  

All visualizations and clustering results are filtered to the selected tournament and feature mode.

- Running **NMF** across all tournaments may take a few minutes the first time, particularly when switching from unilateral to opponent-inclusive mode.  
- Once computed for a given mode, results of the NMF are stored in the **Streamlit session cache**, making switching between feature modes much faster.  
- By default, **unilateral mode** (team-only features) is used.

## üì• Data

- The dataset is **match-level**, with approximately **500 engineered features per team per match**.  
- Original raw data comes from [StatsBomb](https://github.com/statsbomb) via [StatsBombPy](https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy).  
- Event-level StatsBomb data was processed and aggregated by me into the match-level dataset used here.  
- Engineered features are stored in `data/processed/`.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Data generation and cleaning are still in progress. Future versions may include updated or extended features.
